AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide. One 
      of the most efficacious treatments for treatment-resistant MDD is 
      electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Recently, magnetic seizure therapy (MST) was 
      developed as an alternative to ECT due to its more favorable side effect profile. 
      While these approaches have been very successful clinically, the neural 
      mechanisms underlying their therapeutic effects are unknown. For example, 
      clinical "slowing" of the electroencephalogram beginning in the postictal state 
      and extending days to weeks post-treatment has been observed in both treatment 
      modalities. However, a recent longitudinal study of a small cohort of ECT 
      patients revealed that, rather than delta oscillations, clinical slowing was 
      better explained by increases in aperiodic activity, an emerging EEG signal 
      linked to neural inhibition. Here we investigate the role of aperiodic activity 
      in a cohort of patients who received ECT and a cohort of patients who received 
      MST treatment. We find that aperiodic neural activity increases significantly in 
      patients receiving either ECT or MST. Although not directly related to clinical 
      efficacy in this dataset, increased aperiodic activity is linked to greater 
      amounts of neural inhibition, which is suggestive of a potential shared neural 
      mechanism of action across ECT and MST.
